External SUMO code
------------------

Files stored here are single files taken from the `Eclipse SUMO project <https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/>`_ and the source code found `from the github page <https://github.com/eclipse/sumo>`_.

This particular files are licensed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0 with the GNU General Public License version 2 or later as secondary license.

This allows me to link them to the rest of the code of co2carpool which is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0.

Linking those files does not change their license itself, so this files don't fall under the GNU Affero General Public License.

The files have been modified for my purpose and have removed a lot of stuff which I don't need (I really only need the CO2 calculation function for different vehicles for the HBEFA4 model).
